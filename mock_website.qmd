#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Map of Georgia"
#| fig-align: center
import geopandas as gpd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

shapefile_path = "/Users/danielnickas/Downloads/LIHTC-Project_mock_website/data/cb_2022_us_state_20m.shp"
states = gpd.read_file(shapefile_path)
georgia = states[states["NAME"] == "Georgia"]
georgia.plot(edgecolor='black', color='lightblue')
plt.title("Map of Georgia")
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
